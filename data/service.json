Variations of the name exist as various   nightclubs offer Bottle Service, Table Reservations or Beverage Spend   minimum\u2019s.So what is the catch and why is it so confusing and how does   it all work? Well we set to explain how you can purchase bottle service   at discounted rates while enjoying all the perks of a VIP in the   nightclub. If Hosted Entry is more your style and just gaining admission   in a timely manner is for you but if you\u2019re looking to receive the real   VIP service with your own private section roped off to the public   including seating and a dedicated staff then read on. What Is Bottle Service? Bottle Service is the catch phrase now used by every visitor seeking the   full service VIP experience during their stay. First made popular in   Europe in the late 80&#39;s the concept has now spread to the United States   of America and has perfected it above and beyond any other nightlife   establishment. In order to receive Bottle Service you must always   reserve a table (e.g. Table Service), usually a minimum number of   Bottles must be purchased even after you have paid for a table   reservation and some Nightclubs charge for both.    On average you can be expected to purchase 1 bottle per 3 persons that   are male and 1 bottle per 4 persons which are female. The minimum number   of bottles to be purchased starts at two on weekends and requires more   if your group size exceeds the threshold amounts. What Is A Table Reservation?  Making a reservation usually involves Reserving a Table and Purchasing   the minimum number of bottles. Some nightclubs, strip clubs and concert   venues require a minimum number of bottles to be purchased depending on   the night and\/or weekend and some nightclubs enforce a table reservation   fee for premier table placement (e.g. Dance Floor). Reserving a table   is the most important part of the VIP Reservation process as it involves   your table location. You want to avoid being positioned next to the   bathroom, busy walkways, door entrances, etc. The value in our VIP   service is that we have table seating charts for all the Nightclub   venues and can identify your table position in advance prior to arriving   at the club.  What Is A Beverage Minimum? Nightclubs are now enforcing a &#39;Beverage Minimum&#39; or &#39;Minimum Spend   Amount&#39; moving away from the traditional Bottle Service prices and   minimums. This new system accounts for the clients total spend at the   venue less tax and gratuities. Therefore Food, Beverage and any special   request that may incur and additional cost are factored into the   Beverage Minimum giving you the flexibility to spend as much as needed   regardless of the number of bottles purchased.

VIP Passes will allow you to skip the long club lines   and gain entry  without having to pay any additional tips or gratuity to   doormen, hosts, etc.  What Is VIP Hosted Entry? VIP Hosted Entry involves the assistance of an in person  Host. These   individuals meet you out in front of the club and walk you to your    table or past the long lines outside the venue. Hosted Entry is   recommended for  individuals not familiar with the Nightlife industry or   those who prefer a  hassle free ability to enjoy a night out without   waiting in lines. Hiring a personal  VIP Host enables you to enjoy the   perks of a VIP and allowing you to enjoy your  break as intended! Why Do I Need A Nightclub VIP Line Pass? UK2VIP arranges trips to huge tourist destinations and  everyone   attending the Nightclubs and entertainments facilities are usually    visitors which makes it easier for Nightclub doormen and hosts to hold   you in  place until you raise a tip or &#39;handshake&#39;. The Clubs have no   incentive to let  you right in as the longer nightclub lines make the   venue look full and the  opportunity to gross better wages with tips is   achieved. VIP Passes will at the  very least grant you the ability to   bypass the long lines without any games  being played at the door.   Without a Bottle Service Reservation or Pre-Purchased  VIP Pass you are   left to deal directly with the Nightclub Doormen and if the  lines are   long good luck negotiating a good rate when you\u2019re only alternative  is   to wait.
